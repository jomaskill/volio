# About
This is a small sample project, to create a person and send emails.
<br>
The tack stack for this project is
* Laravel
* Mysql
* TailwindCss
* Mailpit

## Setup
 * Clone the repo
 * Install dependecies
    ```
    cp .env.example .env
    composer install
    npm install
    ```

I have setup services for mysql, and mailpit, you just have to build the containers
   ```
   docker-compose up
   ```
Now we wil start the Php server, along with node

   ```
   php artisan serve
   npm run dev
   ```
To see the application go to

``
http://localhost:8000
``

To check the email server, just go to

   ``
  http://localhost:8025
   ``

I've made a some tests, fell free to check it out with

   ```
   php artisan test
   ```
